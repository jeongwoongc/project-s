# This directory will contain trained ML model weights
# 
# Expected files:
# - cfm_toy2d_v1.mlmodel - Core ML model for 2D flow matching
# - velocity_field_v1.mlmodel - Simplified velocity field model
# - unet_dense_v1.mlmodel - U-Net for dense flow field prediction
#
# Models should be generated using the training pipeline in /model/
# and exported using export_coreml.py
